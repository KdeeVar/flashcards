## Spanish Flashcards
This set of flashcards is designed to help with general family conversation speaking points.
This project has been generated by Claude.AI as an experiment in AI-assisted software development.
I have done some very minor refactor to extract data and interface definitions to separate files, 
but otherwise this is the code as generated by Claude.AI. 

## React + TypeScript + Vite
Vite was used to create the initial project scaffolding to house the Claude.AI generated code.

## React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
